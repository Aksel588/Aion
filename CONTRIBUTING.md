# Contributing to Aqwel-Aion

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Aqwel-Aion! We welcome contributions from the AI research and development community.

## 🌟 How to Contribute

### 🐛 Reporting Bugs

1. **Check existing issues** first to avoid duplicates
2. **Use the bug report template** when creating new issues
3. **Provide detailed information**:
   - Operating system and Python version
   - Aqwel-Aion version
   - Steps to reproduce the bug
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Error messages and stack traces

### 💡 Suggesting Features

1. **Check the roadmap** to see if your feature is already planned
2. **Open a feature request** with detailed description
3. **Explain the use case** and why it would benefit AI researchers
4. **Provide examples** of how the feature would be used

### 🔧 Code Contributions

#### Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aqwelai/aion.git
   cd aion
   ```

2. **Set up development environment**
   ```bash
   pip install -e .[dev,full]
   ```

3. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

#### Development Guidelines

**Code Style:**
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Write comprehensive docstrings with examples
- Keep functions focused and modular

**Testing:**
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Ensure existing tests pass: `pytest`
- Aim for >90% test coverage

**Documentation:**
- Update docstrings for any changed functions
- Add examples to demonstrate usage
- Update README.md if adding new modules

**Commit Messages:**
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Follow conventional commits format:
  - `feat:` for new features
  - `fix:` for bug fixes
  - `docs:` for documentation changes
  - `test:` for adding tests
  - `refactor:` for code refactoring

#### Code Review Process

1. **Submit a Pull Request** with clear description
2. **Link related issues** using keywords (fixes #123)
3. **Ensure CI passes** (tests, linting, type checking)
4. **Respond to feedback** from maintainers
5. **Update documentation** if needed
